## üöÄ About Ship Guard

[Ship Guard](https://shipguard.dev) is an AI-powered code review assistant that integrates directly with your GitHub pull requests. By defining rules in a `.github/ship-guard.yml` configuration file, you can automate code quality checks, security reviews, and best practice enforcement across your entire development workflow.

This repository serves as the central hub for sharing and discovering reusable Ship Guard rules created by the community.

## üì• Installation

### Option 1: Copy Individual Rules

Navigate to a rule file, copy its contents, and paste into your `.github/ship-guard.yml`.

### Option 2: Use Multiple Rules

Combine multiple rules in your configuration:
````yaml
version: 1
rules:
  - name: "Block Hardcoded Secrets"
    type: "ai-review"
    severity: "error"
    paths:
      include: ["**/*"]
      exclude: ["*.lock", "*.min.js"]
    prompt: |
      Scan for hardcoded API keys, tokens, and credentials...

  - name: "No Console Logs"
    type: "banned-terms"
    severity: "warning"
    paths:
      include: ["src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"]
      exclude: ["**/*.test.*"]
    terms: ["console.log", "console.warn"]
    message: "Use a proper logging library instead."

  - name: "Require Tests"
    type: "ai-review"
    severity: "error"
    paths:
      include: ["src/**/*.{js,ts}"]
      exclude: ["**/*.test.*", "**/*.spec.*"]
    prompt: |
      Check if this code change includes corresponding tests...
````

### Option 3: Import Base Configuration (Coming Soon)
````yaml
version: 1
extends:
  - "shipguard/community-rules/presets/javascript-strict"
  - "shipguard/community-rules/presets/security-essential"
````

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Security-First Setup

Perfect for applications handling sensitive data:
````yaml
version: 1
rules:
  # Include all security rules
  - !include rules/security/block-hardcoded-secrets.yml
  - !include rules/security/sql-injection.yml
  - !include rules/security/xss-prevention.yml
  - !include rules/security/enforce-https.yml
````

### Example 2: Code Quality Focus

Ideal for maintaining high code standards:
````yaml
version: 1
rules:
  - !include rules/code-quality/no-console-log.yml
  - !include rules/code-quality/require-docstrings.yml
  - !include rules/code-quality/complexity-check.yml
  - !include rules/testing/require-tests.yml
````

### Example 3: Custom Severity Levels

Adjust rule severity for your team's workflow:
````yaml
version: 1
rules:
  - name: "No Console Logs"
    type: "banned-terms"
    severity: "error"  # Upgraded from warning to error
    paths:
      include: ["src/**/*.ts"]
    terms: ["console.log"]
````

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

### Quick Contribution Checklist

- [ ] Rule name is descriptive and follows naming conventions
- [ ] Includes comments explaining purpose and use cases
- [ ] Paths are properly scoped with include/exclude

## üìñ Rule Schema Reference

### Rule Types

Ship Guard supports three types of rules:

#### 1. `banned-terms`
Searches for specific strings or patterns in code.
````yaml
name: "Rule Name"
type: "banned-terms"
severity: "error" | "warning" | "info"
paths:
  include: ["**/*.js"]
  exclude: ["**/*.test.js"]
terms:
  - "console.log"
  - "debugger"
message: "Custom message to display"
````

#### 2. `ai-review`
Uses AI to perform contextual code analysis.
````yaml
name: "Rule Name"
type: "ai-review"
severity: "error" | "warning" | "info"
paths:
  include: ["src/**/*"]
  exclude: ["*.lock"]
prompt: |
  You are an expert reviewer. Analyze the code for...
  - Specific thing 1
  - Specific thing 2
  Provide actionable feedback.
````

#### 3. `file-size`
Checks file sizes against thresholds.
````yaml
name: "Rule Name"
type: "file-size"
severity: "warning"
paths:
  include: ["**/*"]
max_size: "100KB"
message: "File exceeds size limit"
````

### Path Patterns

Use glob patterns for file matching:

- `**/*` - All files recursively
- `src/**/*.js` - All JS files in src directory
- `**/*.{js,ts}` - All JS and TS files
- `!**/*.test.js` - Exclude test files (alternative to exclude array)

### Severity Levels

- **`error`** - Blocks PR merge, requires resolution
- **`warning`** - Flags issue but allows merge
- **`info`** - Informational only, no blocking

## üéì Best Practices

### Writing Effective AI Prompts

1. **Be Specific**: Clearly state what to look for
2. **Provide Context**: Explain why the rule matters
3. **Give Examples**: Show patterns to detect
4. **Request Actionable Feedback**: Ask for specific improvement suggestions
5. **Set Boundaries**: Specify what NOT to flag

### Scoping Rules Properly
````yaml
# ‚úÖ Good: Specific and targeted
paths:
  include: ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx}"]
  exclude: 
    - "**/*.test.*"
    - "**/*.spec.*"
    - "**/fixtures/**"
    - "**/__mocks__/**"

# ‚ùå Bad: Too broad, will slow reviews
paths:
  include: ["**/*"]
````

### Choosing Severity Levels

- Use `error` for security issues, critical bugs, or strict requirements
- Use `warning` for code quality, best practices, or potential issues
- Use `info` for suggestions, educational content, or optional improvements
