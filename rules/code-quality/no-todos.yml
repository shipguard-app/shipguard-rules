# Flag unresolved TODO comments before merging to production
#
# Use Case:
# TODO comments are useful during development but indicate incomplete work.
# This rule helps ensure that:
# - All planned work is tracked in your issue tracker
# - Code merged to main branches is production-ready
# - Technical debt is properly documented
# - No unfinished features slip through code review
#
# Example violations:
# // TODO: Fix this edge case
# // TODO: Add error handling
# # TODO: Optimize this query
# /* TODO: Refactor this method */
#
# Example fixes:
# 1. Complete the TODO and remove the comment
# 2. Create a ticket (e.g., JIRA-123) and reference it:
#    // TECH-DEBT: Optimize query performance (see TICKET-456)
# 3. If it's not important, remove the comment
#
# Configuration note:
# Adjust severity based on your workflow:
# - "error" for strict no-TODO policy
# - "warning" to flag but allow merge with approval
# - "info" to just track TODOs
